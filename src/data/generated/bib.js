        "abstract": "Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.",

        "abstract": "Social relationships are the basis for communication and collaboration between players in many online games. In this article, we propose a machine-learning-based approach to model the relationship between players and guilds in online games. Our approach combines deep learning techniques with useful prior expert knowledge, where the core component is a graph convolutional network that is designed to utilize both social relationships and behavior preferences of players. For each player in the game, the model is trained to estimate the likelihood of whether the player matches the guild, which enables rapid matching of players and guilds via recommendation. The proposed approach is evaluated on an industrial dataset collected from a popular online game and also deployed in the game as a basic component of the social system. Experimental results show that our approach is not only intuitive but also very superior to other baseline methods.",

Different terms are being used for the security issues of games in the literature like cheat, exploit, hack, attack. Massively multiplayer online role-playing games are joining the ranks of software popular enough to be bombarded by attacks. In this study, we explore the security issues of an online game and its protection measures on a sample game. We will use a Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) strategy game that we have been developing as our case study, which utilizes different aspects of MMO concept that contains many security issues. We tried to point out the vulnerable points of MMO games and provide sufficient solutions to these problems by using an MMO strategy game as in our case study.",

However, based on 23 empirical studies involving 6,772 subjects, our meta-analysis shows that this relationship is significantly weakened in massively multiplayer online (MMO) games. Our results suggest that game genre, which is often overlooked in existing theories, warrants more attention in future research on game addiction. For game developers, our results suggest that it is particularly important for non-MMO games to provide a good match between game challenge and player skill level, which is essential to the flow experience. As MMO games have been reported to be more addictive than non-MMO games, future research should also investigate the unique characteristics of MMO games that cause addiction in this game genre.",

        "abstract": "The balance of game content significantly impacts the gaming experience. Unbalanced game content diminishes engagement or increases frustration because of repetitive failure. Although game designers intend to adjust the difficulty of game content, this is a repetitive, labor-intensive, and challenging process, especially for commercial-level games with extensive content. To address this issue, the game research community has explored automated game balancing using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. However, previous studies have focused on limited game content and did not consider the importance of the generalization ability of play-testing agents when encountering content changes. In this study, we propose RaidEnv, a new game simulator that includes diverse and customizable content for the boss raid scenario in the MMORPG games. Additionally, we design two benchmarks for the boss raid scenario that can aid in the practical application of game AI. These benchmarks address two open problems in automatic content balancing, and we introduce two evaluation metrics to provide guidance for AI in automatic content balancing. This novel game research platform expands the frontiers of automatic game balancing problems and offers a framework within a realistic game production pipeline. The open-source environment is available at a GitHub repository.",

A large number of player experience questionnaires are available, but in most cases empirical validation of the scales is limited or absent. Two of the most commonly used scales are the Player Experience of Need Satisfaction (PENS) and the Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ). Both scales were developed using a rational-theoretical approach, but neither scale has had formal factor-analytic studies published, limiting our capacity to judge the empirical validity of the scales.

This research paper aims to determine the importance and relevance of strategy in role-playing games and promote the strategy element to be incorporated in role-playing games. Based on reviews of different existing games, a game level design document was produced. Analysis of the completed document showed that the \u2018strategy\u2019 element is indeed important in role-playing games. Further research is needed to identify if strategy should be incorporated into every genre of games other than role-playing games.",

        "abstract": "Game feel design is the intentional design of the affective impact of moment-to-moment interaction with games. In this article, we survey academic research and publications by practitioners to give a complete overview of the state of research concerning this aspect of game design. We analyzed over 200 sources and categorized their content according to design purposes. This resulted in three different domains of intended player experiences: 1) physicality; 2) amplification; and 3) support. In these domains, the act of polishing, which determines game feel, takes the shape of tuning, juicing, and streamlining, respectively. Tuning the physicality of game objects creates cohesion and predictability, and the resulting movement informs level design. Juicing is the act of polishing amplification and it results in empowerment and provides clarity of feedback. Streamlining allows a game to act on the intention of the player, supporting the execution of actions in the game. These three design intents are the main means through which designers control minute details of interactivity and inform the player\u2019s reaction. The presented framework and its nuanced vocabulary can lead to an understanding of game feel that is shared between practitioners and researchers as highlighted in the concluding future research section.",

        "abstract": "Due to the advent of the Internet, massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) have been enjoyed worldwide by many players simultaneously, and game publishers\u2019 revenues have reached billions of dollars from subscriptions alone. Frequent updates (e.g., versioning) and new contents (e.g., quest system) are the typical strategies adopted by developers to keep MMORPG experiences fresh and attractive. What makes such strategies attractive and retains the interest of players in MMORPGs? This study focuses on one aspect of a popular MMORPG: the player\u2019s experience of the quest systems of Final Fantasy XIV (FF14). The different quest systems were analyzed considering Bartle\u2019s players\u2019 classification, specifically for the explorers and achievers. From an information science perspective, such an analysis can be achieved via game refinement (GR) theory, which formulates the information of the game\u2019s progression into a measurable model of game sophistication. On top of that, we used the concept of motion in mind, which was derived from concepts in physics. It maps game progression information to enable the possible quantification and approximation of players\u2019 mental movements and affective experiences in the game. Based on the analysis of the collected data using the proposed measures of GR and motion in mind, the impact of regular updates on players in long-term games is discussed. Insights from the study provide guidance and suggestions for potential improvements in long-term game design.",

        "abstract": "In day-to-day life, stress can arise due to various factors including work\u2013life demands, external situations, and health issues. Stress becomes a concern when it affects a person's mental health, and sometimes it can even result in other chronic illnesses. Currently, stress-detection studies in the literature are often limited to laboratory studies or to specific situations. However, daily stressors are ongoing, and therefore, detection of stress in everyday life (outside the laboratory environments) is important to improve the wellbeing of individuals. Computer games are entertainment media that can be found in almost every household in the modern society. Statistics show that people spend hours playing computer games daily. The amount of data that gameplay generates and interactivity they provide via various human computer interfaces have a lot of potential in identifying behavior patterns of the players that could assist in the process of stress detection. As such, this survey attempts to identify the extent to which computer games can be used as a medium for stress detection. Toward this end, this survey reviews the existing stress-detection studies, both laboratory techniques as well as the techniques that can be used in a home-based environment. Finally, it summarizes the stress-detection techniques that can be used within games in order to make it an everyday technology that can be used to detect and monitor stress. In addition, it is expected that development of such a technology will be useful in providing objective data to the healthcare professionals for intervention and management. Such a technology is even more required in the current unprecedented situation the world has faced due to the COVID-19 pandemic as it can be developed as a technology to manage mental health issues people are facing due to home isolation.",
